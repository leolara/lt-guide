# 04 Project set up

**TODO**

Here we should explain how to set up a project and define its process

When starting a project we should define:
 + Who is in which roles for this particular project. That helps to define the responsibilities and accountabilities in this project. At LT different people can be in different roles on different projects
 + Which type of project is this initially, this idea can change as we communicate with the user
 + Which of the different management template are we going to use. This might change if we see this is a different type of project. The template can be modified
 + Define which management tools are used

All this decisions should be accounted for in the README of the project, or linked from it
