# 03 Project types

LT has a rich variety of projects that are very different to each other and have different needs. It is very useful to try to categorise them, so we can take decision about which process are better for them.

By the contractual relationship:

 + Best Effort Project. Closed scope, best effort estimation. The client wants a defined/bounded end result, but trust us that we will do it with our best effort, and hence only requires a rough estimate of the effort
 + Closed Project. Closed scope, committed estimation. The client wants a defined/bounded end result, but wants us to give him a committed estimation that we cannot exceed
 + Utility project. Open scope, best effort estimation per task. The client does not have a defined/bounded end result, for example, may want tech support or bug fixing on a running project

By the organisation size and maturity, for example a start up, a big enterprise, a local authority, a government agency or translational organisation.

Other important considerations:

 + Does the project requires a lot of research? There must be technical uncertainty or other type of uncertainty.
 + Is the project bootstrapping a new product from nothing?
