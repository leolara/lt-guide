# 02 Glossary 

Many disagreements are caused because people use the same word with different meaning, and if they realised it their positions would be much closer

## Roles

Roles are groupings of activities that are played by different people, **not titles people own**. Hence, at the beginning of the project it is decided who plays each role.

**Account Manager (People guy)**

 + To gain the client for LT
 + Keep a relation with a potential client or old client that could hire us again
 + To talk with the client and be the official voice of the company regarding a particular project

**Programme manager (Big picture guy)**

 + Works across several related projects that need coordination

**Product Manager (Requirements guy)**

 + Bring clarity to the project
 + Understand Client’s project needs and wants deeply
 + To handle all communication that comes from the account manager/client, and transform requirements into unambiguous, fully documented requirements and product design
 + Together with the Tech Lead to transform requirements into fully documented issues & tasks that are ready to be assigned to developers

**Project Manager (Scheduling guy)**

 + Scheduling engineers and resources with already defined tasks
 + Handle delays, potential risks, re-schedules and anything that can affect the project, if the need arises
 + If the teams are small this can be done by either the Product Manager or the Tech Lead
 + Understand and using the engineering task management tools and can from it infer the status of the project what has been done what not has been done, and keep the client up to date from it.

**Tech Lead (Geeks spokesman)**

 + In projects with more than one engineer, there should be a tech lead that may also be doing a role of engineering if the team is not too big. The tech lead should be a software engineer. In projects with one engineer this will also have to take on the role of Tech Lead
 + Help transform fully documented requirements into fully documented issues & tasks that are ready to be assigned to developers
 + To act as the main representative of the development team, and be part of it. Whenever the team needs to be asked something, he/she is the most adequate person to address these inquiries
 + To have a high-level overview of all the components/systems involved in the project. Developers can only have, most of the time, an understanding of the components they’re working on. Should understand all functional aspects of the project, but also the technical ones (though at a higher level)
 + To help developers understand the requirements and work with them on the best architecture/implementation solutions. Therefore, the PM should be someone with strong skills in software engineering and development
 + Write job descriptions for engineers and Vet Engineer candidates
 + Perform auxiliary, but important, tasks that a project might need, like introduce new members to the project, perform demos, help with QA, write READMEs and documentation, etc.

**Software Engineer (Geek)**

 + Implement fully documented tasks and issues without distractions
 + Follows the practices decided in the Engineering team and with the Tech Lead for a specific project

Other roles that we do not seem to need now in LT but will be use in the future: Engineering Manager, Software Architect, Solutions Architect.
