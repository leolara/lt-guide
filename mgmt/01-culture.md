# 01 Project Management culture and philosophy

## Summary (DOs and DON'Ts)

**TODO**

## In LT we have a project management framework (not a single process)

LT has a rich variety of projects that are very different to each other and have different needs. Hence, we need a framework that is common in LT but can adapt.

## Async culture

Remote asynchronous work is better and more efficient for Software Engineering that location dependent work in a Open Space office. Actually, for Software Engineers a open space office is the less efficient possible space. This might be difficult to understand for managers.

How managers and engineers manage their time is incredibly different. And we should understand this, in order to avoid misunderstanding and hindering each other.

Please read this article http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html that explains this very succinctly.

Instructions for Managers when communicating with Engineers:

 + Whatever the tool (chat, task management, e-mail) do not expect immediate responses. This is the key of async communication, I make a questions/request now, it will be answered later
 + This has another side, if you really need to have a synchronous communication with an Engineer, although this should be avoid at all cost, ask him what is the best time for Engineers to have a meeting and set it up in Google Calendar. Understand that the costs for him of a meeting in the middle of his time is huge comparing with yours, so we should accommodate for the times that are less disruptive for them
 + Understand the right tool for communicating each thing. For the requirements of a particular task, it will be the task management tool. For setting up a meeting perhaps you can ask in slack (expecting a async response) or via e-mail. Ask the engineer what is the best method for each subject
 + In a project with several Engineers communicate with the Tech Lead always

Instructions for Engineers communicating with Managers:

 + A manager is not your boss, he has a role in the development of the project and you have a different one
 + Do not worry if you do not reply immediately to managers questions/requests. If he is expecting immediate responses remind him/her to read these guidelines
 + Do no hesitate to remind the manager that he should follow the decided processes and use the right tools for each subject

## Plan then execute, then plan again

An engineering task is performed:

 + Usually in minimum units of half a day
 + Requires full focus
 + The order in which tasks are executed is important

The tasks/cycles *cannot*:
 + Be based on a lot of disperse data that have to be remembered by memory where it is and how it is all connected
 + Be performed while having conversations, and even less while having a conversation about the task itself
 + Be changing requirements, if requirements change that will be done in the next cycle or in another task

Hence, independently of the management process we follow using pure kanban, scrum or whatever, some things are always a must:
 + All the information about each tasks should be clearly laid out in one place and be unambiguous, even if there are many design documents and assets, this should be link from here. It is the responsibility of the Product Manager to keep and produce this information before tasks/projects/cycles are due to start. The Tech Lead should guide the ProdM on this and decide whether they are enough unambiguous and complete

## Bring clarity

**TODO**


## Be humane

**TODO**

## Feel good about improving the framework where it is broken

**TODO**

## Process should not be a barrier for the client

**TODO**

## Tech leadership, oversight and architecture

**TODO**

## We do what is best for the client

**TODO** This whole section is controversial and complex, we should think how to design this better, and be more balanced. Also perhaps too verbose

*And this is not usually what the client thinks is best*. Clients in general will not be Software Engineers, and hence their ideas and expectations about how the project should be done will be 100% wrong.

**CONTROVERSIAL** Like a Medical Doctor will never prescribe medicine or surgical procedure that thinks is wrong for the patience, we will never implement what or in the way the Engineers think is wrong for the client. It is our **ETHICAL** responsibility to implement what the Client needs, as opposed what the client think is his/her need, and with the best internal quality as possible.

It might be tempted to just be the proxy of client wishes, and this could get an instant gratification. But, in the long run the client will become unsatisfied as the project becomes more clunky and when he goes to a another consultant, it will advise that the current code is poor and we will be blamed, justifiably so.

Hopefully, the client will come with a previous product design, and this will solve many problems. In any case, it is a responsibility of the Product Manager to understand what the client needs as opposed to what the client says it needs, organise client thoughts and help him understand what he actually need.

It is responsibility of the Tech Leader to decide what of what the client need can be done and how much effort will need. The Product Manager role in this case to communicate to the client the decisions of the Tech Lead as if they were a Medical Doctor decision. The Patient can take the Medical decision or go somewhere else, but the patient will not change the MDâ€™s mind.

Better lose a client this way, that losing it because we built a product that is not useful for him and full of bugs.

It will never be possible for the Product Manager to push back on the Tech Lead to change his expert decision.

The opposite of this is the client making technical and management decisions, which it makes no sense, if that would be the right approach our job would be trivial and unnecessary.

**On the other hand, the best procedure can be to educate the client using small changes**
